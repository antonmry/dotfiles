description: Capture content from a zellij pane by name (e.g., nvim, codex) and help with errors
argument-hint: <pane-name>
---

Run `~/bin/zellij-pane.sh $ARGUMENTS` to capture the pane output.

Then review the output and help with any errors, issues, or questions. If there's a compilation error, test failure, or other problem, explain what's wrong and suggest a fix.
